# Human Image Segmentation 
This README provides an overview of a project that implements human segmentation using the U-Net model, a popular deep learning architecture for image segmentation tasks. The project aims to segment human subjects from images or videos, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, including image editing, surveillance, and computer vision.

# Introduction
Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments, each of which represents a region with distinct features. Human segmentation is a specific type of image segmentation where the goal is to isolate human subjects in images or videos. The U-Net architecture, proposed by [Ronneberger et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597). in their paper U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation, has proven to be highly effective for such tasks.

# U-Net Model
The U-Net model is a convolutional neural network architecture that consists of a contracting path and an expansive path. The contracting path is responsible for capturing contextual information from the input image, while the expansive path is responsible for precise localization of the target objects. U-Net has been widely used in various medical and non-medical image segmentation tasks, including human segmentation.

# Implementation
To use the U-Net model for human segmentation:

Prepare your dataset, which should include images with annotated human subjects or masks indicating the region of interest (ROI). Make sure you have both training and validation data.

Define the U-Net architecture. You can use pre-trained models or create a custom U-Net architecture, depending on your specific requirements.

Train the model on your dataset. The training process involves feeding the model with input images and their corresponding masks and optimizing the network to learn the segmentation task.

After training, the model can be used to perform human segmentation on new images or videos.
